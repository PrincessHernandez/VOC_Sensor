### Week 12 January 22, 2018
* [Sunlight Sensor Build Instruction](https://github.com/RaphaelNajera/Sunlight_Sensor/blob/master/README.md)


### Week 11 January 15, 2018

* [PowerPoint Presentation](https://github.com/RaphaelNajera/Sunlight_Sensor/blob/master/documentation/Sunlight%20Sensor%20-%20Presentation%20-%20Raphael%20Najera.pptx)


### Week 10 January 8, 2018
* Progress Report: Sunlight Sensor

  The recent project activities I did for my hardware project are, I first choose my sensor that I will be working on which was the sunlight sensor. So far, I wrote the proposal, project schedule and budget. I have acquired the main hardware components needed for my project. The hardware components that I have acquired is raspberry pi, sunlight sensor and Connector Interface. In my project schedule this would completed the ID 6 Buying my components/parts. I also research on setting up my raspberry pi and connected my sunlight sensor to the connector interface on the raspberry pi. After that, I tested the code and I was able to get the data from the sunlight sensor of Visible light (Vis), Infrared light (IR) and UV – Light (UV Index). I also recorded the 30 second build video of unboxing the parts, connecting the part and powering up. On my project schedule I have completed id 9 to 13.

  The current progress in meeting the objectives of the project is going well. I have received the required components to build my project and then tested the sensor. On Jan 8, I demonstration my sensor to the professor. I was able to retrieve the data from the sunlight sensor.  The next objective is to write the build instruction and PowerPoint for the presentation.  
  
  The problem I encounter when setting up the sunlight sensor to work with the raspberry pi was I had some problem on running the code to retrieve data from the sunlight sensor. When I first run the code, it output an error “ImportError: No module named Adafruit_PureIo.smbus”. I found out I had missing files. On the website I found there was a fix to the error. I had to clone “ https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_Python_PureIO.git” and “sudo python setup.py install” which will add the missing module Adafruit_Purelo.smbus to fix the error. After I install setup.py I was able to run the code successfully and was able to display the data from the sunlight sensor.
  
  As of right now the projects financial update is currently still in budget. I believe there no reasons that I will exceed my budget as all my hardware and component needed has been acquired.

### Week 6 (October 16, 2017 - November 27, 2017)
During the Past 5 Weeks the school was on strike. This is what I worked on during the strike:
* Started reading the build guide on how to connect my sensor to my raspberry pi.

* I enable the I2C Bus in my raspberry pi 3 to allow the sensor to connect to the Raspberry Pi. I also blinked the LED on my raspberry pi 3.
* I received the module that I was missing to complete the Student Sense Hat from the prototype lab on the week of October 30, 2017

* I Connected the sunlight sensor to my raspberry pi 3  and Filmed the part assembly for my build video
* I set up the code for the sunlight sensor to test. It prints out Vis (visible light), IR (infrared light) and UV Index (UV-Light)
* Output of testing the Sunlight Sensor:

* Watched videos on how to solder.
* On Wednesday October 18, I went to the prototype lab to solder my PCB board for the student sense hat. As of right now I have completed soldering for the PCB board. I'm now missing the module need to complete the student sense hat. The next step is to test the PCB board to see if it will power up.

### Week 4 October 2, 2017

* During the weekend I started to buy the parts needed for my project.
* During class I also tried to test out the Raspberry pi lab testing the light blinking but I wasn't able to connect the Raspberry pi to the computer. I followed the step but got into a problem when connecting to the raspberry pi. I use Raspberry pi #153 from the part crib.
* After class I received the PCB board and parts kit for the Student Sense Hat from Kelly at the prototype lab. The next step is I have to solder the component to the PCB board.
* Recived the Grove I2C Sunlight Sensor / UV / IR and Pi2Grover - Grove Connector Interface for the Raspberry Pi on October 12.

* I Used the program called fritzing to add my name to the PCB board. I then sent an email attched with the gerber files to vlad/kelly to request for the PCB board.

### Week 1 September 11,2017
* I created my [repository](https://github.com/RaphaelNajera/Sunlight_Sensor) and choose the sensor that I will be building with for my IoT Hardware project.
* The sensor I choose is Sunlight sensor. 
* I started to research about the sunlight sensor and build guide on what to build with the sunlight sensor which will help me on creating my proposal that is due next week.
