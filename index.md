# CENG317 VOC Sensor Project


### Week 1 September 11,2017
* I created my [repository](https://github.com/princesshernandez/VOC_Sensor) and choose the sensor that I will be building with for my IoT Hardware project.
* The sensor I choose is Sunlight sensor. 
* I started to research about the sunlight sensor and build guide on what to build with the sunlight sensor which will help me on creating my proposal that is due next week.
