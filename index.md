# CENG317 VOC Sensor Project

### Week 9 October 30, 2018
* I designed my PCB through [Fritzing](https://github.com/PrincessHernandez/VOC_Sensor/blob/master/documentation/Fritzing%20CCS811/VOC-CCS311-Princess.fzz).
    * Breadboard ![Image of Breadboard](https://github.com/PrincessHernandez/VOC_Sensor/blob/master/images/VOC-CCS311-Princess_bb.png =100x20)
    * Schematic ![Image of Schematic](https://github.com/PrincessHernandez/VOC_Sensor/blob/master/images/VOC-CCS311-Princess_schem.png?raw=true)
    * PCB ![Image of PCB](https://github.com/PrincessHernandez/VOC_Sensor/blob/master/images/VOC-CCS311-Princess_pcb.png?raw=true)
* I submitted my [Gerber files](https://github.com/PrincessHernandez/VOC_Sensor/tree/master/documentation/Gerber/VOC%20CCS811) to Prototype Lab.
* I updated my project's [budget](https://github.com/PrincessHernandez/VOC_Sensor/blob/master/documentation/BudgetUpdated.xlsx) to accommodate for the PCB. 

### Week 8 October 23, 2018 - Milestone
* I forgot my Raspberry Pi. 
* Demonstrated wiring on breadboard (borrowed Rasp Pi from Parts Crib).

* Used i2cdetect command to detect CCS811 sensor on the pi. The result is the correct address (0x5B).

### Week 2 September 11, 2018
* I submitted my [proposal](https://github.com/PrincessHernandez/VOC_Sensor/blob/master/documentation/ProposalContentPrincessRev02.xlsx).

### Week 1 September 4, 2018
* I created my [repository](https://github.com/PrincessHernandez/VOC_Sensor) and choose the sensor that I will be building with for my IoT Hardware project.
* The sensor I chose is a VOC sensor.
